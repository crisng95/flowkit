# CURRENT_HANDOFF.md

**Current phase:** DESIGN / RESEARCH  
**Current maturity:** L4 — Researched Design  
**Last completed action:** Created Architecture Draft V0.1 and completed independent review rounds 1–10.

## Current findings

- FlowKit remains valuable as execution/reference backend, not as full creative domain.
- `ShotSpec + Shot IR` is the strongest candidate for canonical generation intent.
- Persistent semantic state is required in addition to parent-image inheritance.
- provider-specific prompts must be compiled, never canonical.
- static QA and targeted repair are mandatory gaps.
- modular monolith is the current topology candidate.
- long-form support requires Sequence/Scene/Beat/Shot and restart-safe production state.

## Current design decisions

Candidate only, not frozen:
- Story → Sequence → Scene → Beat → Shot.
- Shot is generation unit.
- keep/adapt FlowKit entity/ref/chaining/queue.
- use provider adapters.
- use severity-based QA.
- targeted repair maps failure to earliest responsible layer.

## Unresolved questions

1. What local DB and transaction strategy?
2. Windows-only or cross-platform?
3. Required v1 providers?
4. Target concurrency/project scale?
5. Secret storage method?
6. Artifact retention policy?
7. Commercial licensing constraints?
8. Packaging/update strategy?

## NEXT_EXACT_ACTION

Run the next design-hardening block:

```text
1. Persistence/Data architecture options:
   SQLite WAL vs SQLite + job journal vs embedded Postgres-class alternative.
2. Define transaction ownership and optimistic concurrency.
3. Define artifact-store atomicity/reconciliation.
4. Build Failure & Recovery Matrix.
5. Build Security Model.
6. Draft API/contract schemas.
7. Start requirement→component→data→test traceability.
8. Re-run independent reviews for new findings.
```

Do not start feature coding yet.
